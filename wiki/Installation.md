## Option 1 — Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run Markdown Viewer is with a single Docker command. The pre-built image is available from the **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name markdown-viewer \
  -p 8080:80 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/thisis-developer/markdown-viewer:latest
```

Then open **http://localhost:8080** in your browser.

### Available Image Tags

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `latest` | Latest stable build from the `main` branch |
| `main` | Same as `latest` |
| `<commit-sha>` | Pinned to a specific commit |

---

## Option 2 — Docker Compose

For a more reproducible local setup, clone the repository and use Docker Compose.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThisIs-Developer/Markdown-Viewer.git
cd Markdown-Viewer
```

### 2. Start the application

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The application starts on **http://localhost:8080**.

### 3. Stop the application

```bash
docker compose down
```

### docker-compose.yml overview

```yaml
services:
  markdown-viewer:
    image: ghcr.io/thisis-developer/markdown-viewer:latest
    container_name: markdown-viewer
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

You can change the host port by modifying the left side of `8080:80` (e.g., `3000:80`).

## Option 3 — Self-Hosted Static Web Server

Because the application is 100% client-side, you can serve it from any static web server.

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThisIs-Developer/Markdown-Viewer.git
cd Markdown-Viewer
```

### Serve with Python (no dependencies)

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

### Serve with Node.js `serve`

```bash
npx serve . -p 8080
```

### Serve with VS Code Live Server

Open the project folder in VS Code and click **Go Live** in the status bar.

> **Note**: Opening `index.html` directly with `file://` may have limitations with some browser security policies. Using a local server is recommended.
